Have `class=\"popBubble\"` and `data-pop-text` attribute in place within your links as well as `data-pop-form` attribute with an ID of your form (see below)\r\n  2. You will also need to actually create the form within your html with the same ID as in the `data-pop-form` attribute in your link. *Note that currently the script and CSS in this plugin (or app, if you wish) only supports simple forms with a single button and a single text-input field*\r\n  \r\n  -\r\n  And that's pretty much it. Feel free to use however you wish and contribute your code if you like.","google":"UA-73063986-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
